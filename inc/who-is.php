          I am a recent graduate of the Faculty of Informatics and Communication Technologies. My graduation project
          was in the field of Robotics. I was working as a graphics designer, but I have decided to learn video editing
          after a couple of years. I've been editing for the last three years and have known since then I would make a
          career out of it. I've done loads of freelance work and worked two years as an editor for an office at faculty
          doing spotlight and Facebook videos and images for a faculty's needs. I am highly experienced in using Adobe
          Suite, especially After Effects, Premiere, Photoshop, and Illustrator. Also, I am the owner of a camera, and I
          shoot videos by myself. I enjoy working with people. In my free time, I practice sports with my friends.
